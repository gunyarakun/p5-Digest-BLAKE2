NAME
    Digest::BLAKE2 - Perl XS interface to the BLAKE2 algorithms

SYNOPSIS
        use Digest::BLAKE2 qw(blake2b blake2b_hex blake2b_base64 blake2b_base64url blake2b_ascii85);

        # blake2b
        print blake2b('Japan Break Industries');
        print blake2b_hex('Japan Break Industries');
        print blake2b_base64('Japan Break Industries');
        print blake2b_base64url('Japan Break Industries');
        print blake2b_ascii85('Japan Break Industries');

        # blake2s
        print Digest::BLAKE2::blake2s('Japan Break Industries');
        print Digest::BLAKE2::blake2s_hex('Japan Break Industries');
        print Digest::BLAKE2::blake2s_base64('Japan Break Industries');
        print Digest::BLAKE2::blake2s_base64url('Japan Break Industries');
        print Digest::BLAKE2::blake2s_ascii85('Japan Break Industries');

        # object interface provided by Digest::base
        my $b = Digest::BLAKE2->new('blake2s');
        $b->add('Japan Break Industries');
        print $b->digest;
        print $b->b64digest;

DESCRIPTION
    The "Digest::BLAKE2" module provides an interface to the BLAKE2 message
    digest algorithm.

    The cryptographic hash function BLAKE2 is an improved version of the
    SHA-3 finalist BLAKE. Like BLAKE or SHA-3, BLAKE2 offers the highest
    security, yet is fast as MD5 on 64-bit platforms and requires at least
    33% less RAM than SHA-2 or SHA-3 on low-end systems.

    BLAKE2 comes in two flavors. BLAKE2b is optimized for 64-bit
    platforms—including NEON-enabled ARMs—and produces digests of any
    size between 1 and 64 bytes. BLAKE2s is optimized for 8- to 32-bit
    platforms and produces digests of any size between 1 and 32 bytes.

    This interface follows the conventions set forth by the "Digest" module.

FUNCTIONS
    None of these functions are exported by default.

  blake2b($data, ...)
  blake2s($data, ...)
    Logically joins the arguments into a single string, and returns its
    BLAKE2 digest encoded as a binary string.

  blake2b_hex($data, ...)
  blake2s_hex($data, ...)
    Logically joins the arguments into a single string, and returns its
    BLAKE2 digest encoded as a hexadecimal string.

  blake2b_base64($data, ...)
  blake2s_base64($data, ...)
    Logically joins the arguments into a single string, and returns its
    BLAKE2 digest encoded as a Base64 string, without any trailing padding.

  blake2b_base64url($data, ...)
  blake2s_base64url($data, ...)
    Logically joins the arguments into a single string, and returns its
    BLAKE2 digest encoded as a urlsafe Base64 string, without any trailing
    padding.

  blake2b_ascii85($data, ...)
  blake2s_ascii85($data, ...)
    Logically joins the arguments into a single string, and returns its
    BLAKE2 digest encoded as a Ascii85 string, without any trailing padding.
